# Lineage designations for RSV-B
This repository contains the definitions of lineages for RSV-B following the proposal put forward in  [**Standardized Phylogenetic Classification of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Below the Subgroup Level**](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/8/24-0209_article) by Goya et al and the RSV Genotyping Consensus Consortium.

Please refer to the preprint for an in-depth discussion of the lineages and nomenclature. You can assign your own sequence data to the different lineages using [Nextclade](https://clades.nextstrain.org) or [UShER](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgPhyloPlace).

## Lineage maintenance

To define a new lineage, add "lineage YAML" file to the folder `lineages`. These files have the following format
```yaml
defining_mutations:
  - locus: F
    position: 172
    state: Q
  - locus: F
    position: 103
    state: V
name: B.D.4
parent: B.D
representatives:
- OK649704
- OK649708
- OK649705
- OK649728
- OK649726
- KY249677
- KY249670
- KY249667
unaliased_name: B.5.4
```

Once a new yaml file got added and merged into master, run the [helper scripts](https://github.com/rsv-lineages/helper-scripts) to regenerate the autogenerated markdown summaries and clade-tsv files.
```shell
python ../helper-scripts/generate_markdown_summary.py --input-dir lineages --lineage B
python ../helper-scripts/construct_tsv.py --input-dir lineages --output-tsv .auto-generated/lineages.tsv
```
